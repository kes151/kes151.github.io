## About me 

Kathryn Sanford is a third-year PhD student of English literature at the University of Miami. Focusing on medieval and early modern literature, she is primarily interested in utilizing psychoanalytic approachesâ€” namely trauma theoryâ€” to dissect narratives of the monstrous. In her future research, she intends to explore how monstrous elements impact romantic narratives in medieval literature.

Kathryn is also a TTRPG enthusiast and a hobby jewelry maker.
