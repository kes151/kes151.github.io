## About me 

Kathryn Sanford is a third-year PhD student of English literature at the University of Miami. Focusing on medieval and early modern literature, she is primarily interested in utilizing psychoanalytic approaches— namely trauma theory— to dissect narratives of the monstrous. In her future research, she intends to explore how monstrous elements impact romantic narratives in medieval literature.
